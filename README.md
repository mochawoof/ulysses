the entire book of Ulysses by James Joyce!!!

it has 2 command line arguments, the first specifying the number of characters you want to see and the second being where it starts. Without them it spits out the entire book.

if you specify the argument "read" before the other two, it'll progress by the number you specify each time you hit enter instead of just cutting everything else off.
